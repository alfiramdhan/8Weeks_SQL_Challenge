This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

- Pizza Metrics
- Runner and Customer Experience
- Ingredient Optimisation
- Pricing and Ratings
- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)



## A. Pizza Metrics

1. How many pizzas were ordered?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id)as total_pizza
FROM customer_orders;
```


2. How many unique customer orders were made?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)as total_customer_order
FROM customer_orders;
```


3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
