### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

As the runner_orders table is not neat so it needs to be corrected first, then we can use the Temp runner_orders_cleaned to find the answer

```sql
SELECT runner_id,
	COUNT(order_id)as total_orders_delivered
FROM runner_orders_cleaned
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
```
### Answer :
- Runner 1 has 4 successful delivered orders
- Runner 2 has 3 successful delivered orders
- Runner 3 has 1 successful delivered order

	COUNT(r.order_id)as total_pizza_delivered
FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
JOIN runner_orders_cleaned r on c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
```
### Answer :
