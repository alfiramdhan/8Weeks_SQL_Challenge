## üçù Solution - A. Pizza Metrics

### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id)as total_order
FROM customer_orders_cleaned;
```
### Answer :
- There were 14 pizzas ordered
----

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)as total_unique_order
FROM customer_orders_cleaned;
```
### Answer :

----

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

As the runner_orders table is not neat so it needs to be corrected first, then we can use the Temp runner_orders_cleaned to find the answer

```sql
SELECT runner_id,
	COUNT(order_id)as total_orders_delivered
FROM runner_orders_cleaned
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
```
### Answer :
- Runner 1 has 4 successful delivered orders
- Runner 2 has 3 successful delivered orders
- Runner 3 has 1 successful delivered order
----

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT pizza_id,
	COUNT(r.order_id)as total_pizza_delivered
FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
JOIN runner_orders_cleaned r on c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1;
```
### Answer :
- For types 1, 9 were successfully sent
- Meanwhile, for type 2, 3 were successfully sent
----

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
	pizza_name,
	COUNT(c.pizza_id)as total_ordered
FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names p on c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1;
```
### Answer :

```sql
SELECT c.order_id,
	COUNT(pizza_id)as total_pizza_per_order
FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
JOIN runner_orders_cleaned r on c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
### Answer :
- The maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order was 3
----

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
	SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)as order_no_change,
	SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1
		 WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1
		 ELSE 0
            END)as order_with_change
FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
JOIN runner_orders_cleaned r on c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
### Answer :
- Customer 101 and 102 likes his/her pizzas per the original recipe

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
```sql

FROM customer_orders_cleaned;
```
There were a total of 2 pizza deliveries that had both exclusions and extras
----

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
```sql
select extract(hour from order_time)as pizza_hour,
		count(extract(hour from order_time))as number_pizza_ordered,
		ROUND(count(extract(hour from order_time))*100/sum(count(*)) OVER(),2)as total_volume
from customer_orders_cleaned
group by 1
order by 1
```
----

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
```sql
select to_char(order_time, 'Day')as pizza_day,
		count(to_char(order_time, 'Day'))as number_pizza_ordered,
		ROUND(count(to_char(order_time, 'Day'))*100/sum(count(*)) OVER(),2)as total_volume
from customer_orders_cleaned
