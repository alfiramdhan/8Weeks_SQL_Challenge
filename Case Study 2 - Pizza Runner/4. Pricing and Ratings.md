# 🍕 Case Study #2 Pizza Runner

## Solution - D. Pricing and Ratings

### 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```sql
with cte as(	
	SELECT c.pizza_id,
		pizza_name,
		COUNT(c.pizza_id)as total_pizza
	FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
	LEFT JOIN runner_orders_cleaned r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
	LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
	WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 1
)
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN total_pizza * 12
			ELSE total_pizza *10
		   END)as total_amount
	FROM cte;
```  
### Steps :
- Use `LEFT JOIN` to merge and return only rows that have matching values in customer_orders_cleaned table
- Create `CTE` to calculate the total pizza successfully delivered
- Use `SUM()` to calculate the total amount spent on successfully delivered pizzas
  
### Answer :
The total money Pizza Runner has made so far without delivery fees is $138

### 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
- Add cheese is $1 extra

Previously we have cleaned the data on the customer orders table, then we need to unpivot the extra columns

- Step 1 : Unpivot column extras, then replace null with 0 using coalesce
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS order_extras;
CREATE TEMP TABLE order_extras AS
	SELECT order_id,
			customer_id,
			pizza_id,
		CAST(UNNEST(string_to_array(COALESCE(extras, '0'),','))AS INTEGER)as extras
	FROM customer_orders_cleaned;
```
--

- Step 2 : Create segmented table

```sql
WITH segmented_revenue AS (
	SELECT table1.pizza_id,
			table1.pizza_revenue,
			table2.extras_charges,
			(table1.pizza_revenue + table2.extras_charges) AS total_revenue
  	FROM (
		SELECT t1.pizza_id,
				COUNT(t1.pizza_id) * pizza_price as pizza_revenue
		FROM customer_orders_cleaned t1
		LEFT JOIN runner_orders_cleaned t2 ON t1.order_id = t2.order_id
		LEFT JOIN pizza_prices t3 ON t1.pizza_id = t3.pizza_id
		WHERE cancellation IS NULL
		GROUP BY t1.pizza_id,pizza_price
		ORDER BY 1)AS table1
	
	LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT
        t1.pizza_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN t1.extras > 0 THEN 1
            ELSE 0 END) AS extras_charges
	  FROM order_extras t1
      LEFT JOIN pizza_prices t2 ON t1.pizza_id = t2.pizza_id
      LEFT JOIN runner_orders_cleaned t3 ON t1.order_id = t3.order_id
      WHERE
        t3.cancellation IS NULL
      GROUP BY
        t1.pizza_id	)AS table2 ON table1.pizza_id = table2.pizza_id
)	
	
	SELECT SUM(total_revenue)as revenue
	FROM segmented_revenue;
```
--

3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset
- generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

- Step 1 : Create runner_rate consist of order_id, ratings, comment
```sql
DROP TABLE runner_rate;
CREATE TABLE runner_rate (
	"order_id" INTEGER,
	"ratings" INTEGER CONSTRAINT check1to5_rating CHECK (ratings between 1 and 5),
	"comment" VARCHAR(150)
);

INSERT INTO runner_rate ("order_id","ratings","comment")
VALUES
	('1','1','The pizza arrived upside down, really disappointed'),
	('2','2',''),
	('3','2',''),
	('4','1','The pizza arrived cold, really bad service'),
	('5','4','Good'),
	('6',NULL,''),
	('7','3',''),
	('8','5','Fast delivery'),
	('9',NULL,''),
	('10','4','Satisfied');

SELECT *
FROM runner_rate;
```
-- 

4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas

- Keyword : "join all of the information together for successful deliveries"

- STEP 1 : Fixing runner_orders as CTE then LEFT JOIN with other table

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE successful_deliveries AS
	WITH first_layer1 AS (
		SELECT order_id,
				runner_id,
				CAST(CASE WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL
					 WHEN pickup_time = '' THEN NULL
					 ELSE pickup_time
				END as timestamp)as pickup_time,
				CASE WHEN distance = 'null' THEN NULL
					 WHEN distance = '' THEN NULL
					 ELSE distance
				END as distance,
				CASE WHEN duration = 'null' THEN NULL
					 WHEN duration = '' THEN NULL
					 ELSE duration
				END as duration,
				CASE WHEN cancellation = 'null' THEN NULL
					 WHEN cancellation = '' THEN NULL
					 ELSE cancellation
				END as cancellation
		FROM runner_orders
		ORDER BY 1
	),
	
	first_layer2 AS (
		SELECT order_id,
				runner_id,
			CASE WHEN order_id = '3' THEN (pickup_time + INTERVAL '13 hour')
				 ELSE pickup_time
			END AS pickup_time,	
			CAST(regexp_replace(distance, '[a-z]+','')as decimal (5,2))as distance,
			CAST(regexp_replace(duration, '[a-z]+','')as INTEGER)as duration,
			cancellation
		FROM first_layer1
		ORDER BY 1
	)
	
		SELECT t2.customer_id,
				t1.order_id,
				t1.runner_id,
				t3.ratings,
				t2.order_time,
				t1.pickup_time,
				( DATE_PART('hour', pickup_time - order_time)*60 +
				 DATE_PART('minute', pickup_time - order_time) )*60 +
				 DATE_PART('second', pickup_time - order_time)AS Time_between_order_and_pickup,
				t1.duration,
				t1.distance,
				ROUND( t1.distance :: numeric / (t1.duration :: numeric /60),2 ) AS Average_speed,
				COUNT(t2.pizza_id)Total_number_pizzas
		FROM first_layer2 t1
		LEFT JOIN customer_orders t2 ON t1.order_id = t2.order_id
		LEFT JOIN runner_rate t3 ON t1.order_id = t3.order_id
		WHERE t1.cancellation IS NULL
		GROUP BY 
				t2.customer_id,
				t1.order_id,
				t1.runner_id,
				t3.ratings,
				t2.order_time,
				t1.pickup_time,
				t1.duration,
				t1.distance;
```

5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled
- how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

- Step 1 : Fixing runner_orders table
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_cleaned;
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_cleaned AS
	WITH first_layer AS(
		SELECT order_id,
			runner_id,
			CAST(CASE WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL
				 WHEN pickup_time = '' THEN NULL
				 ELSE pickup_time
			END as timestamp)as pickup_time,
			CASE WHEN distance = 'null' THEN NULL
				 WHEN distance = '' THEN NULL
				 ELSE distance
			END as distance,
			CASE WHEN duration = 'null' THEN NULL
				 WHEN duration = '' THEN NULL
				 ELSE duration
			END as duration,
			CASE WHEN cancellation = 'null' THEN NULL
				 WHEN cancellation = '' THEN NULL
				 ELSE cancellation
			END as cancellation
		FROM runner_orders
	)
		SELECT order_id,
			runner_id,
			CASE WHEN order_id = '3' THEN (pickup_time + INTERVAL '13 hour')
				ELSE pickup_time END as pickup_time,
			CAST(regexp_replace(distance, '[a-z]+','')as DECIMAL(5,2))as distance,
			CAST(regexp_replace(duration, '[a-z]+','')as INTEGER)as duration,
			cancellation
		FROM first_layer
		ORDER BY 1,2;

SELECT *
FROM runner_orders_cleaned
```

- Step 2 : Find total_revenue per runner
```sql
SELECT runner_id,
	ROUND(SUM(distance * 0.30),2) as paid_per_km
FROM runner_orders_cleaned
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
So, we get that runner_id 1 earned $19,02 after deliveries,
Then runner_id 2 earned $21,54 after deliveries
And runner_id 3 earned $3 after deliveries.


6. What if substitutes were allowed at no additional cost but any additional extras were charged at $1?
- Exclude Cheese and add Bacon is free
- Exclude Cheese but add bacon and beef costs $1 extra

7. What if meat substitutes and vegetable substitutes were allowed but any change outside were charged at $2 and $1 respectively?
- Exclude Cheese and add Bacon is $2 extra
- Exclude Beef and add mushroom is $1 extra
- Exclude Beef and add Bacon is free
- Exclude Beef and Mushroom, and add Bacon and Cheese is free

8. If 1 unit of each ingredient costs $0.50 - how much net revenue will Pizza Runner make if the costs from question 30 are used?
